// Algorithm
//1. Ask user for number of pods, and store value in an int
//2. Ask user for number of peas in one pod, and store value in an int
//3. Multiply the two values together and store value in an int
//4. Return total value to user

    cout << "Enter the number of peas in a pod: \n"; // ask user for number of peas per pod (assuming that they all have the same amount
    cin >> peas_per_pod; // user inputs number of peas in each pod
